      <h1>Our history</h1>
      <p className="aboutus">
        CARRÉ ROUGE started up in 1991 with a clear international mission and
        with the intention of dressing young people who are engaged with their
        environment, who live in the community and relate to each other. Young
        people who have a casual dress sense, who shun stereotypes and who want
        to feel good in whatever they are wearing. To meet their needs, CARRÉ
        ROUGE takes the latest international trends, mixing them with the
        influences that are seen on the street and in the most fashionable
        clubs, and reworks them according to their style thus turning them into
        comfortable and easy to wear garments. CARRÉ ROUGE evolves at the same
        pace as its customer, always watching out for new technologies, social
        movements and the latest artistic or musical trends. All of this can be
        seen reflected not only in its designs but also in stores. Inspired by
        the legendary Californian city of Palm Springs, the product lines are
        constantly being updated. All stores worldwide receive new merchandise
        twice a week. Belonging to the Inditex Group (Zara, CARRÉ ROUGE, Massimo
        Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Zara Home and Uterqüe), CARRÉ ROUGE
        is present in 76 markets through a network of more than 970 stores and
        the online store.

      <h1>Collections</h1>
      <p className="aboutus">
        CARRÉ ROUGE brings the latest international trends to the street in the
        form of easy, comfortable and casual clothes. The CARRÉ ROUGE collections
        are conceived with the idea of dressing men and women with a young
        mindset, taking into account that age is not an obstacle when choosing
        our wardrobe. CARRÉ ROUGE has two completely different lines for both guys
        and girls. On one hand, teenagers will find the more casual lines in
        stores in the form of sweatshirts, t-shirts, jeans, Bermuda shorts,
        plimsolls and hats, where cotton is the main fabric. The second line is
        directed at more adult male and female consumers who have grown up with
        the brand. For them CARRÉ ROUGE creates garments that are inspired by the
        latest international trends for both daytime and evening wear, and that
        can be worn at work and during leisure time. This line adapts these
        trends to the needs of CARRÉ ROUGE customers, making them more relaxed and
        turning them into easy-to-wear garments. The textile collection is
        backed up by the footwear, accessory, jewellery, fragrance, headphones,
        longskates and sunglasses lines.
